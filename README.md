# Relational Database Project

This is a group project attempting to simulate working in a real-world development team. We're building a relational database-backed application and managing development using a CI/CD pipeline deployed on AWS.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Project Concept

We're building a system that uses:
- A normalized SQL database (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- A backend API to interact with it (Flask/Express/etc.)
- Automated testing and deployment via CI/CD on AWS

The goal is to get hands-on experience with:
- Database design
- Backend development
- CI/CD pipelines
- Team-based workflows and version control

---

## ðŸ‘¥ Open Roles

You can take on any of the following, depending on how many wish to participate we can merge/divide these roles as needed:

- **Database Architect** â€“ Design schema, manage migrations
- **Backend Developer** â€“ Build and maintain the API
- **DevOps Engineer** â€“ Set up AWS and CI/CD (currently in progress)
- **QA/Test Engineer** â€“ Write and maintain tests, linting, CI quality gates
- **Project Manager** â€“ Help coordinate and assign tasks (we'll work as a team)
- **Documentation Lead** â€“ Improve the wiki, setup guides, and code docs
- **API Designer** â€“ Define RESTful endpoints and documentation

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)explains setup instructions, or ask someone in the discord
4. Check open issues or create a new one if you want to propose something

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack (tentative)

- **Backend:** Python (Flask) / Node.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Hosting:** AWS (EC2 or ECS)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## ðŸ“Œ Goals

- Get everyone experience working in a real-world codebase
- Practice version control, code reviews, and CI/CD
- Simulate a dev team environment with role specialization
